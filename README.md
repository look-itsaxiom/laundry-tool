# Laundry Tool ðŸ§º

A web application to help track your laundry rotation through different stages. Built with TypeScript, React, and Express.

## Features

- **Drag & Drop Interface**: Intuitive swim lanes for tracking laundry status
- **Four Stages**: Queue, In Washer, In Dryer, and Fold Ready
- **Smart Constraints**: 
  - Queue lane supports multiple items with reorderable positions
  - Washer, Dryer, and Fold Ready lanes support only one item at a time
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, update, and delete laundry cards
- **Persistent Storage**: Backend API with SQLite database

## Tech Stack
